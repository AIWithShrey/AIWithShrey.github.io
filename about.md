## Hey there!

I'm **Shreyas Mocherla**, a Cloud-Native AI Engineer and **CNCF Kubestronaut** currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at **Nirmata**, where I specialize in building production AI systems for Kubernetes governance and platform engineering.

## What I'm Working On

At Nirmata, I've developed core components of the **AI Platform Engineering Assistant** (launched at KubeCon North America 2025):

- **[Kyverno MCP Server](https://github.com/nirmata/kyverno-mcp)** - A Model Context Protocol server that enables language models to generate and validate Kubernetes policies using Kyverno
- **NCTL AI Agent** - A conversational CLI tool that transforms natural language into policy-as-code
- **Multi-agent orchestration systems** for policy workflows that reduce what traditionally takes hours into minutes

## Technical Expertise

**Infrastructure & Cloud Native**
- Kubernetes, Kyverno, OPA, Helm, Argo, Terraform, Docker
- AWS, Azure

**AI/ML & Development**
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI
- RAG architecture, Multi-agent systems
- Go, Python, YAML, CEL

## Recognition

- **CNCF Kubestronaut** - One of the youngest globally to earn this distinction (January 2025), holding all five CNCF Kubernetes certifications (CKA, CKAD, CKS, KCNA, KCSA)
- **NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute Certified Instructor**
- **TensorFlow Developer Certificate** holder
- **Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)**

## Background

I'm a Computer Science student at Missouri University of Science and Technology, where I also run the **ACM AI Special Interest Group**. My journey started with deep learning and computer vision, eventually expanding into cloud-native technologies as I faced the challenges of deploying and scaling AI applications in production.

This intersection of AI and infrastructure is where I've found my passion - making AI-powered automation work at scale in enterprise Kubernetes environments.

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss:
- AI agents and LLM applications in infrastructure
- Kubernetes policy and governance
- Cloud-native development and platform engineering
- Open source contributions
