Hello Reader! My name is Shreyas Mocherla and I'm currently a Senior at Missouri University of Science and Technology pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science.

My interests lie in Deep Learning, Open-Source and Cloud Native technologies. I run the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) AI Special Interest Group at my university, holding the TensorFlow Certified Developer title from Google.

I have worked on various Deep Learning projects so far including but not limited to Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Image Classification, and many more Computer Vision related projects.

I also have experience building language models (I made a neural network speak like Shakespeare, implemented Semantic Analysis of Tweets, etc).

Apart from the last three years of experience in DL, I am branching my skills into the world of Open-Source technologies such as Linux, Containers and Serverless Computing.

As an AI developer, I always faced the challenge of shipping my application due to the lack of underlying infrastructure and the missing approach of making my application accessible to a large user base (scaling my application without hiccups).

In 2024, I aim to bring my skills in AI with Cloud Native technologies such as Containerd and Kubernetes to be able to serve my compute intensive apps to a wide audience.

With that said, I am also a Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS) and plan to become a Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) by the end of 2024.

I am currently looking for internships in the field of AI/ML and Cloud Native technologies. If you have any opportunities, feel free to reach out to me at shreyas@shreyasm.com
