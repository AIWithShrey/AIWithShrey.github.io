        I'm a Junior majoring in Computer Science at Missouri University of Science
        and Technology. I'm the university's youngest TensorFlow (AI framework by Google) certified developer
        and also the youngest NVIDIA University Ambassador. I lead the university's ACM AI chapter and conduct various
        workshops and events related to AI and ML. I'm also an NVIDIA Deep Learning (DLI) Certified Instructor, allowing me to 
        use NVIDIA GPU Cloud to democratize AI and ML through the 'Fundamentals of Deep Learning' workshop.

              Built a chatbot using the latest LLM Technology for lawyers to easily understand the legal documents and contracts. These documents contain a lot of information and can be difficult to interpret as junior lawyers/interns. 
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
              Currently working on a project to build a chatbot for the university's ACM chapter. This chatbot will help students get information about the chapter and also help them get information about the events and workshops conducted by the chapter.

              Currently helping build a dataset for an object detection project to identify different typed of drones
              flying in the sky. This project is being built for the military to identify drones and take appropriate action.
