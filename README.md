# All about me

## Education
- B.S, Computer Science | Missouri University of Science and Technology (_Fall 21' - Fall 25'_)
- Diploma, International Baccalaureate | Indus International School, Hyderabad (_May 2021_)

## Work Experience
**NVIDIA University Ambassador (_Dec 2022 - Present_)**
- Missouri University of Science and Technology's youngest NVIDIA University Ambassador (Usually given to professors)

**NVIDIA University Ambassador. (_Dec 2022 - Present_)**
- Missouri University of Science and Technology's youngest Deep Learning Institute Certified Instructor and Univesity Ambassador.
  
- Delivers a semesterly workshop on Fundamentals of Deep Learning. Free for students and certification upon passing the assessment.

**Product Engeering Intern @ InfraCloud Technologies (_June 2024 - August 2024_)**
- Developed a platform for AI developers to deploy applications on a GPU-enabled cluster, enabling a cost-efficient, pay-as-you-go approach using high-performance infrastructure.

- Automated platform-building processes using:

  - Network booting: Simplified setup for multiple machines.
  - Orchestration: Deployed Kubernetes to manage cluster operations.
  - AI-stack integration: Implemented Hugging Face's Text Generation and Embedding Inference stack, and explored NVIDIA NIMs for faster, more efficient workflows.

- Generative AI PoC: Built a proof-of-concept involving a chatbot driven by a Generative AI agent equipped with tools to turn conversations into actions, such as searching the web or Stack Overflow and analyzing the team's Slack messages for real-time insights. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Function-Calling, InSightful (https://github.com/infracloudio/insightful) delivers actionable results with minimal input.

- Collaborated with an incredible team of talented professionals whose mentorship was invaluable in refining my technical and problem-solving skills.

**Summer Intern @ LegalCraft Solutions (_June 2023 - August 2023_)**
- Worked closely with the development team to build a chatbot that lawyers can use to interact with their private documents pertaining to a specific case. LegalCraft's product, Lexel, is a platform for lawyers to collaborate and work on various documents together.

- The chatbot helps in acquiring important details regarding the case with a query in the simple natural language form. The chatbot excels in summarising, producing a timeline of events, extracting important entities and their corresponding details as well.

- Utilized Microsoft Azure (Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search Services) to cut operational costs and increase the overall security concerning the customers and their data.

## Certifications
- TensorFlow Certified Developer
- Linux Foundation Certified Systems Administrator
- Certified Kubernetes Application Developer
- NVIDIA DLI Certified Instructor

## Projects
### BLIP2 Fine-Tuning on NYT unmasked dataset

- Used Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training Version 2 (BLIP2) model to predict the news category on a given NYT image.
  
- Fine-Tuned the model to generate an NYT-style headline for a given image, making it a "headline generator".

- Image captioning with the flavours of NYT headlines.

### Celebrity Song Player
- Building an application using TensorFlow for image recognition and Spotify API to identify Bollywood actors/actresses and play a random song from one of their movies.
  
- Listen to the songs of your favorite actors and actresses by simply pointing your smartphone camera at their image!
  
- Currently in-progress, curating the dataset is the biggest challenge to this project.

### Pneumonia detector
- Used a pre-trained image recognition model (VGG16) on TensorFlow Hub and fine-tuned it to find traces and the presence of Pneumonia in a given x-ray scan of the lungs.
  
- The model returns a boolean (True or False) value to show the presence of Pneumonia, making this a binary classification project.
